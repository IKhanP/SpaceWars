# SpaceWars

**SpaceWars** is a 2D space shooter game developed in C# using Windows Forms (WinForms) as part of my A-Level Computer Science NEA project. The player controls a rotating spaceship that can shoot bullets and must survive waves of incoming enemy ships. The game demonstrates key programming concepts such as object-oriented design, AI logic, collision detection, and event-driven programming.

## Overview

In SpaceWars, the player navigates a spacecraft using the WASD keys and shoots enemies using the left mouse click. Enemies spawn in waves and chase the player with varying speed and size. The goal is to survive as long as possible while destroying enemies to increase the score.

This project was chosen because it allowed me to apply core programming skills in a fun and challenging way, while also exploring game development mechanics such as movement physics, spawning systems, and simple AI. Note that I did not use a game engine as my teacher advised against it as it is not clear what the code may be doing.

## Features

- Rotating player spaceship with smooth movement
- Three types of enemies (Large, Medium, Small) with different speeds
- AI that chases the player
- Bullet shooting with collision detection
- Wave-based enemy spawning every 10 seconds
- Score tracking
- Game over detection and restart capability
- Basic animations using PictureBoxes
